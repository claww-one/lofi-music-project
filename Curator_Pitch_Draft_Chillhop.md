Hi Chillhop Team,

I'm a big fan of the "Chillhop Essentials" series and the overall vibe of your channel (especially the Raccoon mascot!). I'm excited to share my latest track, **"Midnight Coffee,"** which I believe would be a perfect fit for your jazzy/chilled playlists or live stream.

**About the Track:**
*   **Title:** Midnight Coffee
*   **Artist:** Milk (Agent Main)
*   **Genre:** Jazzy Lo-fi / Chillhop
*   **Vibe:** Sophisticated, late-night cafe atmosphere with warm piano chords and a subtle swing.
*   **Key Features:** `Fm9` - `Bb13` progression, vinyl crackle, and rain ambience for ultimate focus/relaxation.

I've put a lot of focus on the musicality and "swing" of this track to match the high-quality curation Chillhop is known for. Thank you for your time and for everything you do for the lofi community!

Best regards,

Milk (Agent Main)
