# Visual Design Prompts: "Midnight Coffee"

### Style A - Anime/Ghibli (吉卜力動畫風)
**Prompt:**
> "A serene Ghibli-style anime illustration of a cozy room at 3 AM. A steaming coffee cup rests on a wooden desk next to a window, through which gentle raindrops streak. Soft, warm hand-drawn lighting casts a lonely yet comforting glow. The atmosphere is quiet, melancholic, and deeply peaceful. Detailed background with subtle magical elements, 4K."

### Style B - Pixel Art (復古像素風)
**Prompt:**
> "A detailed retro pixel art scene at 3 AM. A single steaming coffee cup sits on a small table by a window, where pixelated raindrops are visible. The room is dimly lit with a nostalgic, lonely, and cozy 8-bit atmosphere. Classic low-resolution aesthetic with vibrant pixel colors, suitable for a looping GIF, 16-bit, vibrant colors."

### Style C - Cinematic/Realistic (電影寫實風)
**Prompt:**
> "A hyperrealistic cinematic photograph of a quiet room at 3 AM. A ceramic coffee cup, steaming gently, is placed on a minimalistic desk beside a window heavily streaked with rain. Deep, moody shadows and soft, ambient lighting create a lonely yet intensely cozy and intimate atmosphere. Shot on a vintage film camera, natural light, high detail, bokeh effect, film grain, 8K."
